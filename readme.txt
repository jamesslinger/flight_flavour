# Flight Flavour
Built with React.js, you can find cheap flight deals quickly and without hassle.  The site allows you to book any flight you find easily via a third-party affiliate API from Kiwi.com.

My inspiration for this build was to learn React using something I feel could be useful to me and others.
I often find it a hassle to think of affordable holiday destination so wanted a way to quickly see whats available.
The site is front-end only and utilises React Router to manage the API calls via client-side routing. My plans are to update the site with more useful features in the near future, 
including:

- Adding About/Contact pages
- Social media integrations
- Quick Search or Detailed Search option
- Account creation so you can save searches
- Ability to sign up for an email containing flight deals periodically
